## Installation
Follow the steps below to test the project locally. First ensure you have a version of [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) equal or greater than v6.10.0 installed.

1. Clone the repository from a terminal `https://github.com/SmithVyne/JS-TodoList.git`.
2. Navigate to the project directory `cd JS-TodoList`.
3. Install project dependencies `npm install`
4. Run `npm run dev` to compile a development build.
5. Run `npm run start` to serve the project live on `http://localhost:9000` and voila!!!.

## Unit Tests
To run the unit tests,;
1. We need two terminal windows, one to run the tests and the other to serve the project in a browser because the UI tester Puppeteer needs an endpoint to connect to. Puppeteer preferably works best with chrome but also has support for firefox.
2. On the first terminal, run `npm run start` to serve the project live on `http://localhost:9000`
3. On the second terminal, run `npm run test` run both the UI and other unit tests.
